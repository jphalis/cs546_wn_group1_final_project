# cs546_wn_group1_final_project

Final project repository for CS546-WN Group 1 for the fall 2024 semester at Stevens.

## Running the application

1. Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies
2. Run `npm run seed` to populate initial data in the database
3. Run `npm start` to launch the website
4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to view the website

### Run notes

- You can create your own user, but if you'd like to authenticate with a pre-populated one, the console will output user credentials during the seed script execution.
- Most of the functionality is hidden behind authentication, so you'll need to login to view/use most of our features.
